## Auto-update is enabled!

From this version onwards, the app is capable of letting you know when there's a new version of the software available. Depending on the platform you'll get a different behavior:
- For MacOS users auto-update "just works". this means that the app handles both detection of the new version, download and install!. You just have to accept the dialog that will appear when the new version was successfully downloaded.
- For Windows users it should work also very similar, but we are still waiting for more testing on it.
- For Linux users, if you're running an older version of the software, you'll be presented with a Dialog that will let you open a website to download the latest version of the app. It will be either a github.com page or a seedhypermedia.com page.
